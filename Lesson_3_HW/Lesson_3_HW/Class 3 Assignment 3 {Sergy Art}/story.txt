Tom loved apples. Every morning, Tom ate apples. He picked apples from the apple tree. The apples
were red, the apples were sweet. Tom’s friend, Sam, also loved apples. Sam and Tom ate apples
together. “These apples are the best apples,” said Tom. “Yes, the best apples,” said Sam. They
laughed, ate more apples, and climbed the apple tree. Apples made them happy.
